            <h1 class="text-red-600 text-3xl font-bold">1. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
            <h1>Var:</h1>
            <p>
                Scope:
                var is function-scoped or globally-scoped if declared outside any function. This means that a var
                variable
                is
                available throughout the function in which it is declared or globally if declared outside any function.
                var does not have block scope (i.e., it is not limited to {} blocks like loops or conditionals).
                <br>
                Hoisting:
                Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning the declaration is moved to
                the
                top
                during the compile phase. However, the initialization remains at the original line. This means they can
                be
                accessed before they are declared, but their value will be undefined until the initialization line is
                executed.
                <br>
                Re-declaration:
                Variables declared with var can be re-declared within the same scope without causing an error.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Let:</h1>
            <p>
                Scope:
                let is block-scoped, meaning it is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it is used. It
                cannot be accessed outside the block in which it is declared. <br>
                Hoisting:
                Variables declared with let are hoisted to the top of their block, but they are not initialized. This
                means they cannot be used before the declaration line within the block (Temporal Dead Zone). <br>
                Re-declaration:
                Variables declared with let cannot be re-declared within the same scope. However, they can be declared
                in different blocks.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Const:</h1>
            <p>
                Scope:
                const is block-scoped, similar to let. It cannot be accessed outside the block in which it is declared.
                <br>
                Hoisting:
                Variables declared with const are hoisted to the top of their block but are not initialized. They also
                have a Temporal Dead Zone, similar to let. <br>
                Re-declaration and Re-assignment:
                Variables declared with const cannot be re-declared within the same scope.
                They cannot be re-assigned after their initial assignment. However, if the variable is an object or
                array, the properties or elements of the object/array can be modified.

        <h1 class="text-red-600 text-3xl font-bold">2. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
        <h1>Undefined:</h1>
        <p>undefined is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not
            yet assigned a value. It indicates the absence of a value at the moment of declaration.</p>
        <h1>Null:</h1>
        <p>null is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to
            indicate that a variable should have no value.</p>

        <h1 class="text-red-600 text-3xl font-bold">3.What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
        <p>A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and
            conventions for building and interacting with web services. It relies on standard HTTP methods and
            principles to enable communication between a client and a server. REST APIs are designed to be stateless and
            to provide a way to create, read, update, and delete resources on a web server. <br>

            Key Principles of REST: 
            <br>
            Stateless:
            Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the
            request. The server does not store any client context between requests, making each request independent. <br>
            Client-Server Architecture:
            The client and server are separate entities that interact over a network. This separation of concerns allows
            for the development and scaling of each part independently. <br>
            Uniform Interface:

            REST APIs have a consistent and standard way of interacting with resources, typically through URIs (Uniform
            Resource Identifiers) and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH). <br>
            Resource-Based:

            The focus of a REST API is on resources, which are identified by URIs. Each resource can have multiple
            representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. <br>
            Stateless Communication:

            Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process
            the request. The server should not store any state between requests. <br>
            Cacheable:

            Responses from the server should be explicitly marked as cacheable or non-cacheable, to improve performance
            and scalability.</p>
